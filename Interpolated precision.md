# Interpolated precision
Interpolated precision $p_{inter}$ at various [[Recall]] levels $r$ can be used.
$$p_{interp}(r) = \max_{r' \ge r} p(r')$$
Max value of p taken is justified since anyone will look at more documents if it increases the number of items that were [[Relevance|relevant]] â†’ [[Precision]] of larger set is higher.
## Extensions
- [[11-point interpolated average precision]]
