# Boolean retrieval model
Queries using boolean expression of terms
## Advanced modification
Utilises tools like [[Biword index]] and [[Phrase queries]] to perform [[Query processing]]. However, the use case for most people is not practical as the search results tends to either return too many hits when used with OR and with too few results when used to too many AND.
## Alternate models
[[Ranked retrieval model]]
